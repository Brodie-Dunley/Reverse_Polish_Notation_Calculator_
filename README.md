# Reverse_Polish_Notation_Calculator_

A program that will be able to take in an expression and appropriately calculate a solution using order of operations.

This project will demonstrate the use of various forms of polymorphism and the udnerstanding to implement the Pre and post fix algorithms stated.

Using the base code provided, read in integers and outputs the result. Add to the existing code base to implement the infix to postfix algorithm (Shunting Yard algorithm) then implement a postifx to result algorithm(Postfix Algorithm). Use one of the following types of solutions:

Big if statement
Operand Polymorph
Operator Polymorph
Double Dispatch
Lookup table
This project used the double dispatch method.
